# Simple-Async-Socket
This project is a simple client server chat program, that uses basic TCP web socket libraries for communication.
All you do it run the server and run a few instances of the client GUI and hit connect. It is setup to connect to
your local machine address, but you can easily make the server address static and use it as a global server. Please keep
the "Packet Support" checkbox on the client GUI checked, the unchecked state was for a class assignment.
